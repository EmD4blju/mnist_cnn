# Mnist CNN
This repository serves as an introductory example for working with deep learning models in Keras, specifically for image classification tasks.

The project includes the implementation of a CNN architecture to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, providing an easy-to-understand approach for those learning the basics of neural networks and deep learning.
